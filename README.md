# Dotfiles

I use VIM/Tmux for my development environment.
I use these configuration files, in conjunction with [Hashrocket's Dotmatrix](https://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix).

I use `zsh` for my shell.

I also use [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) for searching inside of VIM.
I open up the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/) for global search and replace.
